## Setup your first Environment

An environment refers to the cloud or on-prem infrastructure on which you apps will be deployed. The hosting options include:
	
	- Zelthy Cloud Hosting
	- Direct hosting in your own public cloud such as AWS, Azure or GCP.

Zelthy Cloud is a quick and optimized solution for hosting Zelthy Environments, architected to meet high security standards and regulations such as ISO 27001, SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR. If you are choosing to go with self-hosting, you can still secure the security and compliance needs with Zelthy Add-Ons. 


In case you have not yet started your setup, click on the setup.zc file and get started with creating your first environment.
