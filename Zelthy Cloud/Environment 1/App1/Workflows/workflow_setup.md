## What are Workflows?

Workflows are a collection of user interfaces and API endpoints built to exchange data with the App Database. Since users of an app are grouped into user roles (one user can also be part of multiple user roles), its convenient to group workflows among the user roles. As such, when you are inside the "Workflows," the folders you create correspond to the user roles.

Create your user roles by creating the folder.
