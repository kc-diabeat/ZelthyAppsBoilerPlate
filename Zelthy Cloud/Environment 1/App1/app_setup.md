## Setup your first App

Now that the environment is all ready, you can go inside it to create your first app. The folders you create just inside the environment are apps. Just as with environments, simply creating folder woudn't do much, other than reserving the name for your app.

Go inside the app folder and start setting up your app by clicking on Setup.

Your new app will be launched and the status would be available in Setup.


> An app in Zelthy Cloud is a set of workflows divided among a set of User Roles. The 
> workflows are supported by a data storage mechanism.

Accordingly, when the app is successfully launched it will have two boilerplate folders:
- Database
- Workflows
