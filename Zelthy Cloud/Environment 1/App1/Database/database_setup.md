## Understanding Database in Zelthy Cloud

### Introduction

Every app in Zelthy has its own database, supported as schema on a Postgres database. A table on an App's database is called as a Dataclass. Unlimited number of DataClasses can be created for an app with each dataclass having its own custom fields. Relations between dataclasses can also be specified, to achieve complex table structures.


Dataclasses have an advantage that the don't require any migrations into the underlying database and are extremely flexible to customize to the context of the use case, while leveraging the advantages of a relational database.

Zelthy also comes with dataclasses presets for specific use cases. These presets can improve your team's app development timelines to a great extent, considering that the presets already represents the solutioning for the specific use case and can still be further customized.
